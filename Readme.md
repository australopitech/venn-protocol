# NFT rentals using AA. NO COLATERAL and NO TRUST.


tldr
## This project implements a SC wallet/dapp to enable NFT rent tx's completely on-chain and trustless.
Rent NFT's with no colateral and no trust! Unlock the value of NFT's!

Our project is a wallet that uses account abstraction to enable users to rent NFT's without needing colateral in a completely trustless manner. We are currently in development phase, but have already a up and running POC on Base Goerli that includes a browser extension wallet, a dashboard/market place dapp and fully functioning smart contracts.

## About the project

### How does it work?
NFT owner's can use our dapp to list their NFT's and our SC wallet users can rent them for a predetermined amount of time. The asset owner's can rest assured that they will get paid and receive their assets back at the end of the lease because our smart contracts will make sure of it!

How? Our Smart Contract Wallet prevents the rented NFT from ever leaving the renting account before the rent is due. Once the rent expires the only allowed destiny is the NFT's rightfull owner. 

We provide a very simple way to any market place dapp to make itself compatible with our wallet (check [here](link)).

### Main use cases
1. **Gaming**:
With the growth of the gameFi scene this application becomes more and more relevant since most games use NFT's as in game assets. NFT owner's can rent their assets out when they are not playing and get paid for doing so.

2. **Metaverse items**:
Any metavers item manifested as an NFT is also greatly benefited from the use of our protocol. The metaverse economy is gonna get stirred!

3. **Access tokens**:
There are other cases in which NFT's are used as access control. People who hold the NFT gain access to some good or some right/claim. An example is the BAYC which gives people who hold an NFT to engage in their private community and future access to their own metaverse.

### Impact
The impact of our project is very straight forward. It unlocks the real value of any asset that are or can be manifested an NFT. This means present and future cases. As soon as we launch, any owner of these assets will be able to earn passive income on them if there is real demand for holding them.

## Future developments
- Improve smart contract efficiency (gas expenditure)
- Smart contract audit (security)
- Extend dapp functionalities 
    - buying and selling
    - updating Listing metadata
- Improving UI: browser extension and dashboard/market place
- Product idendity and design
